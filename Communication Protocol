To filter out noise over UART a messaging protocol is used.

RULES AND NORMS FOR TRANSMITTING IMAGE DATA:

1 - data is sent row by row
2 - multiple images can be sent sequentially, but where so a 1 second delay is put between send events.
3 - the receiving micro:bit will be able to show multiple images (1 at a time - up to 10 stored in memory).
4 - Excel will ONLY transmit numerals and upper case alphas

Structure of a row of data:
        X3410010
        X   ___   3   ___   4   ___   10010
        ID      Frame     Row         Image data
         
a single row of data ALWAYS has 8 chars
a single row of data ALWAYS starts with "X"
Second char is the target Frame (1 - 10 for 10 frames in total)
Third char is the row that is being transmitted (0 to 4)
Last 5 chars are the image data for the row (0 to 9 - intensity is transmitted in theory, although UI doesn't accomodate it)
Frame ID starts at 1 and goes from 1 - 10
RowID starts at 0 and goes from 0 - 4
