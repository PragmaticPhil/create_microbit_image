As I tested this I noticed a lot of spurious USB comms hitting the micro:bit - mostly ASCII = 0.

To filter out noise a messaging protocol is necessary.  
For once in my life (not really, but you know what I mean ;) I am going to write the protocol before the code:

RULES AND NORMS FOR TRANSMITTING IMAGE DATA:

1 - data is sent row by row
2 - multiple images can be sent sequentially
3 - the receiving micro:bit will be able to show multiple images.
4 - Excel will ONLY transmit numerals and upper case alphas


Structure of a row of data:
        P3410010
        p   ___   3   ___   4   ___   10010
        ID      Frame     Row         Image data
         
a single row of data ALWAYS has 8 chars
a single row of data ALWAYS starts with "X"
Second char is the target Frame (0 - 9 for 10 frames in total)
Third char is the row that is being transmitted (0 to 4)
Last 5 chars are the image data for the row (0 to 9 - intensity is transmitted)
