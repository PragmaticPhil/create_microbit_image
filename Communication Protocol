As I tested this I noticed a lot of spurious USB comms hitting the micro:bit - mostly ASCII = 0.

To filter out noise a messaging protocol is necessary.  
For once in my life (not really, but you know what I mean ;) I am going to write the protocol before the code:

FOR TRANSMITTING IMAGE DATA:

1 - data is sent row by row
2 - multiple images can be sent sequentially
3 - the receiving micro:bit will be able to show multiple images.
