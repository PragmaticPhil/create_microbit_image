# create_microbit_image
Simple and quick way to edit and create images for the micro:bit

How To... get it set up:
1 = Load all the files into the same folder somewhere
2 = Open the XLSM
3 = Enable macros

How To... edit an image:
1 = select any cell  in the row with the image you want to edit
2 = click the Edit button
3 = edit your image - click the big tick when you are done.

How To... create a new image:
1 = click the Create Image button
2 = create your image - click the big tick when you are done.

And of course that tantalising micro:bit button!
... this app is not meant to be a create image app - that a byproduct
... one of the things it will do in time is comm over serial to a micro:bit
... but thats not ready and this is a quite nice way to make and edit images.
I left it in as a deliberate tease, of course ;)

Thanks!
Philip
