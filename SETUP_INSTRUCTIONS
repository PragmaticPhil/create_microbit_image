# Getting started with ex:bit:

### --------- EXCEL:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app is built in Excel - it is a spreadsheet.
I built it and tested it using:
* Excel 2016
* desktop version
* running on Win10
I cannot say for sure whether it will work if you have anything other than those 3 things.

Note also that you do not need to get serial comms working to be able to use ex:bit.  
The functionality to create, edit and preview images and animations works regardless.
So you can use the spreadsheet as a stand-alone tool.

To use ex:bit you will need to do the following:

Step 1:
Move the following files to a location accessible from your machine.  All files listed below need to be saved in the same location:
* exbit_ImageService_02.xlsm
* led_OFF.jpg
* led_ON.jpg

Step 2:
Open the spreadsheet in Excel (DESKTOP version)
Enable macros.

You can now use the spreadsheet!
You will need to enter the COM ID and BAUD to get the serial comms working - see below.

Troubleshooting:
... buttons in the spreadsheet don't work?  Ensure macros are enabled and check the file is saved with .xlsm extension
... I get a file not found error (1) - check that the 2 images are saved in the same folder as the spreadsheet
... I get a file not found error (2) - this can happen if you try to use Serial Comms and the micro:bit is not plugged in.


### --------- ENABLING SERIAL COMMS:----------------------------------------------------------------

A very cool feature of ex:bit is the ability to preview images / animations you are making on a connected micro:bit.
You don't NEED this feature - you can preview them from inside Excel.
But, as I mentioned above, it is pretty cool :)

You need the mBed Serial Driver installed on your machine to enable comms between your machine and your micro:bit. 
I think - looks like it to me (from literature and my own experience), although I never tried without it being installed.
Check step 4 to see where to check if you have it installed.
If you use Mu and REPL then you are fine.

Anyway, to use this feature you will need to do the following:

Step 1:
Download exbit_PreviewModule.hex
Alternately download the exbit_PreviewModule.py file and convert it to a hex file using Mu or the online Python editor

Step 2:
Flash the hex file onto your micro:bit

Step 3:
Ensure your micro:bit is connected via USB to the machine on which ex:bit_ImageService.xlsm is running.

Step 4: 
Identify the COM port that is associated with your micro:bit.
... go to Control Panel / Devices and Printers
... ensure your micro:bit is plugged in.
... you SHOULD see and option "MBED SERIAL PORT" under UNSPECIFIED 
Click on this option and take note of the COM ID (i.e. the number - e.g. COM4 or COM9)

Step 5:
Enter the COM ID into the spreadsheet (you will see where).
Do not change the BAUD (if you HAVE to make sure you change it in the .py too - they must be identical)

And that should be it!

Troubleshooting (First check steps 1 - 5 carefully above):

... I click on the micro:bit image inside the spreadsheet but I see nothing on my micro:bit.
... ... wait for up to 5 seconds (although it should appear within 1 second near enough)
... ... Change your USB cable - just in case its a power-only one.
... ... Is your COM ID > 9?  Excel struggles with this, so change to a single digit
... ... Try clicking the micro:bit button multiple times, like an elevator button.  It actually does help!
... ... Do you have the mBed Serial Driver installed?  Try reinstall if you are not sure.

... The image on my micro:bit is missing a pixel, or perhaps has an extra pixel.
... ... click the micro:bit button again - it should come right.
