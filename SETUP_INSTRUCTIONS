# Getting started with ex:bit:

### --------- EXCEL:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app is built in Excel - it is a spreadsheet.
I built it and tested it using:
* Excel 2016
* desktop version
* running on Win10
I cannot say for sure whether it will work if you have anything other than those 3 things.

Note also that you do not need to get serial comms working to be able to use ex:bit.  
The functionality to create, edit and preview images and animations works regardless.
So you can use the spreadsheet as a stand-alone tool.

To use ex:bit you will need to do the following:

Step 1:
Move the following files to a location accessible from your machine.  All files listed below need to be saved in the same location:
* exbit_ImageService_02.xlsm
* led_OFF.jpg
* led_ON.jpg

Step 2:
Open the spreadsheet in Excel (DESKTOP version)
Enable macros.

You can now use the spreadsheet!

Troubleshooting:
... buttons in the spreadsheet don't work?  Ensure macros are enabled and check the file is saved with .xlsm extension
... I get a file not found error (1) - check that the 2 images are saved in the same folder as the spreadsheet
... I get a file not found error (2) - this can happen if you try to use Serial Comms and the micro:bit is not plugged in.


### --------- EBABLING SERIAL COMMS:----------------------------------------------------------------

A very cool feature of ex:bit is the ability to preview images / animations you are making on a connected micro:bit.
You don't NEED this feature - you can preview them from inside Excel.
But, as I mentioned above, it is pretty cool :)
